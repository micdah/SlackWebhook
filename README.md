# SlackWebhook
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xg5n46bdf223dj2b/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MichaelDahl/slackwebhook/branch/master)

Provides a simple .Net client for using Slack's [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) URL's to send messages to a slack channel of your choosing.

The Webhooks API is pretty simple, but it always preferable to have a typed interface to use rather than an untyped (_and undocumented_) JSON object. So using this library should make it simpler to build a slack message and send it using a webhook URL.

## Example

![Foo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micdah/SlackWebhook/master/demo.png)

## How to use

First **install** the nuget package:
```bash
PM> Install-Package SlackWebhook
```

Next simply use the `SlackClient` class to send a message:
```csharp
await new SlackClient(webhookUrl).SendAsync(b => b
    .WithUsername("Slack Bot Name")
    .WithIcon(IconType.Url, "http://my.host/bot_icon.png")
    .WithText("Something very interesting just happened")
);
```

### How to obtain Incoming Webhook URL

In the above example i used the `webhookUrl` which you obtain by adding the **Incoming WebHooks** app configuration
to the channel you want to send messages to (_each url is tied to a specific channel, so if you want to sent to different
channels, just add multiple configurations_).

1. Open [slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook](https://slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook)
2. Under _Post to Channel_ select the channel you want to send to
3. Press _Add Incoming WebHooks integration_
4. Now copy the _Webhook URL_


## What is supported?

Besides the message, the Slack hook also allows attachments which are pretty neat. 
In the above example I used a few attachments and fields to illustrate some of the uses. Especially the attachment fields are
a good way to include extra detail in a table-like structure (_by setting `short` flag on field, two fields will be shown
in the attachment side-by-side for each row_).

My example was generated by this code:
```csharp
await new SlackClient(webhookUrl).SendAsync(b => b
    .WithText("Hello from *SlackWebhook*")
    .WithUsername("SlackWebhook")
    .WithIcon(IconType.Url, "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micdah/SlackWebhook/master/icon.png")
    .WithAttachment(a => a
        .WithTitle("How to install")
        .WithText("`PM> Install-Package SlackWebhook`")
        .WithColor(Color.DarkSlateBlue))
    .WithAttachment(a => a
        .WithTitle("Find out more")
        .WithText("Find out more by taking a look at github.com/micdah/SlackWebhook")
        .WithLink("https://github.com/micdah/SlackWebhook")
        .WithField(
            "Use builder pattern",
            "```\n" +
            "await slackClient.SendASync(b => b\n" +
            "   .WithUsername(\"My Bot\")\n" +
            "   .WithText(\"Hello *World*\"));\n" +
            "```")
        .WithField(
            "Use object initializer",
            "```\n" +
            "await slackClient.SendAsync(new SlackMessage {\n" +
            "   Username = \"My Bot\",\n" +
            "   Text = \"Hello *World*\"\n" +
            "});\n" +
            "```")));
```
