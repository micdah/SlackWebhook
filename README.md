# SlackWebhook
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xg5n46bdf223dj2b/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MichaelDahl/slackwebhook/branch/master)

Provides a simple .Net client for using Slack's [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) URL's to send messages to a slack channel of your choosing.

The Webhooks API is pretty simple, but it always preferable to have a typed interface to use rather than an untyped (_and undocumented_) JSON object. So using this library should make it simpler to build a slack message and send it using a webhook URL.
